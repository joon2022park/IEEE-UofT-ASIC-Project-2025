Digital Phase-Locked Loop (DPLL) as an ASIC design. 
The DPLL is designed to lock onto an reference oscillator @ 10MHz and generate a high-frequency output clock using a Ring Oscillator (DCO) operating @30MHz.
The feedback clock is rate divided through N-divide with division number of 3, and is phase-compared with the reference clock using a Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) and generate up/down control signal.
PI controller is used for the first-order filter transfer function whose functionality is equivalent to a charge pump.
